    <h2>Details</h2>
  <hr class="section-divider">

  <p>
    This project is a fully custom real-time ray tracer built from the ground up in Vulkan, 
    featuring modern GPU acceleration and physically-based rendering components. 
    <br><br>
    Every layer of the pipeline, from device initialization to final frame presentation, is <b>built 
    with extensible wrapper classes and Vulkan-Hpp</b>. The system operates with dynamic scene support, 
    real-time lighting, and interactive controls using <code>GLFW</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>Core Architecture</h3>
  <p>
    The engine is built around a series of modular C++20 components that abstract and manage all Vulkan primitives:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Device and Queue Management</b>: Wrapper classes handle physical device selection, logical device creation, and queue family setup with full ray tracing and descriptor indexing support.</li>
    <br><li><b>Memory System</b>: Custom allocators manage GPU memory for buffers, images, and acceleration structures using Vulkan's dedicated memory requirements and barriers.</li>
    <br><li><b>Swapchain and Surface</b>: A robust swapchain class handles resizing, re-creation, and per-frame synchronization with optimal present modes and VSync settings.</li>
    <br><li><b>Command Buffers</b>: A Command pool wrapper deals with command buffer creation and submission.</li>
    <br><li><b>Descriptor Set System</b>: A flexible descriptor pool and layout manager binds resource sets per frame with intelligent caching and automatic updates.</li>
    <br><li><b>Pipelines</b>: Custom wrappers for raytrcing and compute pipelines, allowing them to be made with a single command.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Geometry & Instancing</h3>
  <p>
    The renderer supports static and instanced geometry loaded directly from <code>.obj</code> and <code>.mtl</code> files. 
    A bottom-level acceleration structure <b>(BLAS) is constructed for each unique geometry mesh</b>. If identical geometry is reused multiple times in the scene, 
    the system intelligently <b>instances it at the top level (TLAS)</b>, reducing memory usage and build time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Textures are shared across instances using a reference-based texture pool. Repeat textures 
    (UV tiling) are supported natively via per-instance material data, and <b>all loaded textures 
    are managed in VRAM</b> with staging upload on first use.
  </p>

  <h3>Animated Transforms</h3>
  <p>
    Objects and lights both support time-varying transforms, including animated <b>translation</b>, <b>scaling</b>, and <b>rotation</b>. 
    These are encoded per frame and updated in Host-visible storage buffers for efficient access during ray traversal and shading. 
    All transform animation is driven by a lightweight keyframe system for flexibility and performance.
  </p>

  <h3>Custom Shaped Lights</h3>
  <p>
    Light sources can be defined using any arbitrary mesh loaded from <code>.obj</code> files. Emissive geometry is 
    sampled uniformly across its surface area, and the renderer supports both one-sided and two-sided emission models. 
    Animated lights are handled with the same transform system used for scene objects.
  </p>

  <h3>Ray Tracing Pipeline</h3>
  <p>
    The pipeline is fully ray-tracing enabled, using Vulkan’s <code>KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline</code> extension. It includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Primary rays</b> for visibility and shading</li>
    <li><b>Shadow rays</b> for soft shadow approximation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <b>Linearly Transformed Cosines (LTCs)</b> are implemented for area light shading with high efficiency and good visual fidelity. 
    Shadow rays are processed alongside Cook-Torrance shading to allow for biased shadow densoising.
  </p>

  <h3>Denoising and Postprocessing</h3>
  <p>
    In a <b>compute shader</b>, shadow noise is mitigated using a <b>bias estimator</b> and a <b>basic convolution filter</b>, 
    providing temporal stability in direct lighting. <b>Gamma correction and tone-mapping</b> allow for color to come through.
    Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA) is currently in development to 
    improve motion stability and resolve flickering in high-frequency regions.
  </p>

  <h3>Camera & Interaction</h3>
  <p>
    The viewer uses <code>GLFW</code> for windowing and input, with a responsive free-fly c
    amera system modeled after Unreal Engine navigation. Controls include WASD movement, mouse look, and speed toggling, 
    enabling full exploration of real-time ray-traced scenes.
  </p>

  <h3>Performance & Future Work</h3>
  <p>
    The engine currently runs in real time with full per-frame rebuilds of TLAS for animated content, a
    nd selective updates to BLAS for dynamic geometry are being explored. Future features include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Specular reflection rays</li>
    <li>Path-traced indirect lighting</li>
    <li>Multiple importance sampling for emissive geometry</li>
    <li>Deferred or tile-based ray scheduling</li>
    <li>Scene graph editor and USD scene import</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates full-stack Vulkan development with real-time ray tracing, including memory management, 
    descriptor binding, GPU acceleration structures, and physically-based shading. It combines technical 
    depth with rendering accuracy and serves as a flexible platform for experimentation in real-time advanced lighting techniques.
